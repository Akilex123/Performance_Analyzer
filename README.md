# PerformanceAnalyzer


## 📌 Overview

### PerformanceAnalyzer is a Java console application built using pure Java.

#### The main goal of this project is to analyze the performance of different algorithms in terms of execution time and memory usage.

The program provides two main functionalities:

Measure the performance of a single algorithm.

Compare two algorithms to see which one is faster and which consumes less memory.

Currently, the application supports 13+ well-known algorithms, covering arrays, linked lists, hash maps, sorting, and searching.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Java (JDK 17 or higher) – the only technology used (no external libraries).

Java Console – for displaying menus and user interaction.


## ⚡ Features

Interactive console-based menu system.

Measure execution time of algorithms (in microseconds).

Measure memory consumption of algorithms (in bytes).

Compare two algorithms side by side.

Includes implementations of:

Array operations

LinkedList operations

HashMap operations

Sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort

Searching algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search


## 📊 Example Use Case

Check how long it takes to insert 1 million numbers into an Array.

Compare Bubble Sort vs Insertion Sort in both speed and memory usage.

Analyze the efficiency of Linear Search vs Binary Search.


## 🚀 Future Improvements

Add more algorithms (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort).

Add a graphical user interface (GUI) instead of only console output.

Implement export functionality for results (e.g., CSV/JSON).
